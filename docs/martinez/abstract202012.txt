Emergency departments provide an underpinning and safety net for any Health System.  Still, emergency medicine is practiced in a hazardous environment, where high-stakes decisions are made under excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure.  Diverse patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioral disorders create further overlying complexity.  Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for improving the precision, quality, and safety of clinical care, yet methods for incorporating AI-derived insights in clinical practice are under-developed.  In this talk, we discuss statistical learning and user-centered design approaches motivated by emergency medicine practice for kidney disease diagnostics.  Our model applies machine learning methods to routinely available EHR data and reliably identifies ED patients at risk for AKI up to 72 hours before a diagnosis could be made using current consensus criteria.
