Air pollution due to wood burning produces severe health and environmental problems. Spatial methods are needed to estimate particular matter (PM2.5) exposures, and identify locations with high PM2.5 concentrations.  This study performed a spatial analysis of PM2.5 pollutant collected in a mobile campaign in the conurbation of Temuco and Padre Las Casas, Chile. The results of a local spatial autocorrelation analysis suggest that the central zone of Temuco (Las Encinas) tend to cluster high concentrations of PM2.5. A Land Use Regression (LUR) technique was also employed to obtain the main factors that contribute to high concentrations of PM2.5.
